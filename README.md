A very simple PHP personal Curriculum Vitae that uses Kohana Framework in it's backend

[My Personal Curriculum](http://curriculum.gartz.com.br/)

This project was made in a few hours in December 2008 using [Kohana Framework](http://kohanaframework.org/) 3.1

Feel free to fork and make your own curriculum with this. The HTML was made exporting an old curriculum with LibreOffice, that's why the HTML is so bad. But it works (except in Internet Explorer, but who cares?!?)

Probably some time in the future I will make another curriculum website, but not in PHP, because these days I love NodeJS :)
